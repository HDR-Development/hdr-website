#  UNIVERSAL CHANGES 

- ### ![](images/Aspose.Words.f93ce4e3-25f6-48dc-9813-fc237aafe008.002.png) New Mechanics:
  - Edge Canceling
    - Move toward an edge during any of the following states to slide off of the edge and cancel all grounded endlag:
      - Aerials
      - Special fall
      - Shielding
      - Dashing
      - Standing turnaround
      - Runbrake
      - Damage
      - Taunts
  - Wavedashing
    - Input an airdodge during jumpsquat to slide along the ground with a burst of momentum
      - Jump and shield on the same frame will result in a wavedash similar to Rivals of Aether
      - While jump is being input, roll and shield are non-bufferable
      - Wavedashes can pick up items
  - Shield Dropping
    - Tilt down while in shield to drop through platforms (threshold is in between shield tilt and spotdodge)
    - Alternatively, use the (shield + special) or (shield + shield) or (shield + taunt) shield lock shortcut and tilt/tap downwards to shield drop
  - Shield Stopping
    - Shielding can now be performed during initial dash
  - Shield Slide-off follow up
    - Edge slipping caused by shield knockback, or shield slide off happens more often due to parameter changes, and have new interactions:
      - When facing towards the center of the platform you’re standing on you enter a state of pratfall when pushed off
      - When facing outwards of the platform you’re instantly actionable like in melee/pm
  - Jump Cancel Grabs
    - Press grab during jumpsquat to execute a standing grab
  - Dash Attack Cancel Up Smash (DACUS)
    - Input up smash, up tilt, or up and grab between frames 3-10 of a dash attack to execute an up smash with the dash attack’s momentum
  - Dash Attack Cancel Down Smash (DACDS)
    - Input down smash, downtilt, or down and grab between frames 3-10 of a dash attack to execute a down smash with the dash attack’s momentum
  - Dash Item Toss Cancel Item Toss (DITCIT)
    - Input an item toss during the first 6 frames of a dash item toss to slide forward with a lot of momentum
    - Can now be performed with a throw in any direction
  - Glide Tossing
    - Input an item toss during the first 5 frames of a roll to slide forward with a lot of momentum
    - Can be performed with a throw in any direction
    - Speed gained from a glide toss depends on the animation speed of the roll on the last frame before being canceled
      - Due to varying roll animations, this means the timing for a “good” glide toss will vary per character and roll direction (generally, the later into the roll a glide toss is performed, the further the slide)
  - Aerial Glide Tossing
    - Airdodges can be canceled into an item toss during the first 5 frames
    - Airdodges refresh after a successful AGT but are reduced in distance by 10% each time
  - Airdodge Cancels
    - Airdodges can be canceled with an item toss or zair after frame 3
  - Perfect Shield Projectile Reflection
  - Wiggle out of tumble
    - While in tumble, tap the stick to the left or right to transition into normal fall
    - Inputs cannot be buffered during knockback
  - Pivoting / Perfect Pivoting
    - After a dash, flick the control stick in the opposite direction and let go to return to standing
      - If performed during the first 4 frames, you will perfect pivot similar to Smash 4
      - If performed during the next 3 frames, you will pivot in place similar to Melee
  - Ledge Hogging
    - The ledge counts as “occupied” for the first 75% of all ledge animations (varies slightly per character)
  - Double jump cancels
    - Ness, Lucas, Mewtwo, Peach, Yoshi, and Sora can all now cancel the upwards momentum of their double jumps with an aerial attack. They can still rise with an aerial during their double jump by holding the jump button
    - The leniency window for this is 5 frames
    - They can also work with tap jump
  - Crouch out of run
  - Characters can now moonwalk during initial dash; you can perform a moonwalk by performing a half-circle back motion during your initial dash (or otherwise move your stick opposite your character's facing direction without triggering a dash back)
  - Wiggling the control stick to exit tumble will now allow you to exit tumble directly after hitstun ends like in Melee/PM instead of a bit after the tumbling animation starts
  - Can taunt on respawn platform as well as out of dash, run, and run brake
  - Teeter Canceling
    - Taunts, landing lag, and dashes can all be teeter canceled
  - Added support for Bidou and Aidou control schemes
    - When overridden with a held attack/special input, C-stick registers directional inputs for two frames (up from 1 frame in Sm4sh)
    - Allows easier inputs of frame-perfect techniques such as perfect pivots, c-stick moonwalks, and RAR/IRAR
  - Main CSS Changes
    - Character selection is preserved between matches
    - Random now previews the character before the match starts. Hold Z/ZR for traditional random
  - Salty Runback and Quick Exit
    - Input L + R + A + Y + Start to immediately restart a match
    - Input L + R + A + X + Start to exit a match straight to the stage select screen
  - Meter System for Terry, Ryu, and Ken
    - Just like in traditional fighting games these characters have been given a meter of their own for usage in: Special Cancels, EX-Specials, (Super) Special moves and more.
    - Up to 10 units of meter can be gained through dealing damage, and using specials (regardless if these whiff or not).
      - Special moves gain meter equivalent to half their damage on hit rounded to the nearest integer unless otherwise stated
      - Ex-Specials gain no meter upon use
    - More details can be found on the individual character changelogs

- ### ![](images/Aspose.Words.f93ce4e3-25f6-48dc-9813-fc237aafe008.002.png) New Modes:
  - Tag Mode
    - In this custom game mode, a random player starts with the final smash aura! Hit other players to pass it on. Once time runs out, you die!
  - Turbo Mode
    - In this custom game mode, every move can be canceled on hit. Embrace true chaos and create ridiculous combos!

- ### ![](images/Aspose.Words.f93ce4e3-25f6-48dc-9813-fc237aafe008.002.png) New Controls:
  - Added new control options which can be mapped to most buttons:
    - Short Hop
    - Taunt/Footstool
    - Smash Attack
    - Tilt Attack

- ### ![](images/Aspose.Words.f93ce4e3-25f6-48dc-9813-fc237aafe008.002.png) Hitstun / DI / Damage / Knockback:
  - Hitstun is now calculated with a linear formula as it has been in every previous game. In Ultimate, hitstun is logarithmically scaled with knockback, which means hitstun per unit of knockback drops off as knockback increases. This has been reverted to that hitstun scales linearly with knockback, so higher percents should have more hitstun without affecting low percents
    - As a consequence, balloon knockback is no longer present. This was inherently tied to how hitstun was calculated, and we would rather have hitstun that works correctly that does not drop off at mid to high percents than keep balloon knockback

  - Rate multiplier to velocity/acceleration to reach end of knockback trajectory
    - 70 🠚 38
  - Multiplier to initial knockback velocity/acceleration
    - 6 🠚 5
  - Launch angle range from base angle param to apply extra deceleration and further reduced hitstun scaling (damage\_fly\_speed\_up\_min\_max\_angle) 
    - ?? 🠚 89
  - Constant used in linear interpolation for speedup and hitstun scaling based on knockback angle (damage\_fly\_speed\_up\_angle\_rate) decreased:

    - Base Distance: 2 Units 🠚 6 Units
    - Minimum time between inputs: 4F 🠚 2F

    - ASDI distance multiplier: 0.65 🠚 0.5
    - Max SDI pulses 16 🠚 50
  - Drift DI (new)
    - For the duration of aerial hitstun, your horizontal stick position is used to accelerate you left or right
      - In essence, you can DI during hitlag as normal to adjust angle, but then also drift in or out slightly during knockback
    - Effectiveness scales down depending on the initial knockback taken, eventually having no effect above 3.0 launch speed
    - *This change is intended to go hand in hand with the increase in hitstun. The combination of these two changes will result in a combo game that is more freeform, with more potential combo routes, and with a significantly increased level of interactivity in the combo game. On poor or read DI, especially hard DI in, punishes can be decently more significant. On the flipside, when YOU are getting comboed, your DI patterns, both traditional DI and Drift DI, will have a much larger impact on the situation. Many characters will need to be tuned around this over time for them to feel just right*

- ### ![](images/Aspose.Words.f93ce4e3-25f6-48dc-9813-fc237aafe008.002.png) Air Dodging / Wavedashing / Wavelanding:
  - Air dodges function similarly to Rivals of Aether, consisting of linear movement in a direction followed by a stall in place. A short period of inactionable fall follows
  - Airdodges are once-per-airtime, they are not returned until after grabbing ledge or touching the ground
  - Gravity takes effect starting on frame 30 of both neutral and directional airdodges
  - You can airdodge out of tumble after 60F
  - Airdodge speeds have been lowered across the cast to bring wavedash distances more in line with Melee/PM
  - Directional airdodges retain all momentum upon hitting the ground
  - Air dodges now snap to the ground/platforms when nearby, making wavedashes and wavelanding easier and allowing for upwards wavelands
  - Airdodges and wavedashes can also be performed while holding shield with a second shield button input
  - All heavy landing animations and certain characters’ jumpsquat animations have been slightly adjusted for smoother-looking wavedashes and wavelands
  - Wavelands will snap to ground surfaces if the character’s ECB is within 5 units

      - Platdrop stick y threshold: -0.9875 🠚 -0.71
    - Reinstated Axe method for shield dropping
    - Added Melee/ProjectM UCF shield dropping
      - If your shield is angled using the Axe method, the platdrop stick threshold will move higher, and the spotdodge stick threshold will move much lower, so the range for a shield drop is much more accessible
      - The thresholds shift as follows:
        - Spotdodge stick y threshold: -0.75 🠚 -0.8
        - Platdrop stick y threshold: -0.71 🠚 -0.675

  - Initial Dash / Foxtrot
    - Dash Dancing Added; Turnaround window: 6F 🠚 Whole initial dash
      - Initial dash speeds and run accelerations were readjusted to compensate for these changes, they are changed on a per character basis.
      - Turn dash now only stops you in place for 2F rather than 3F, making dash dancing much smoother
      - Snappier turn dash animations have been added for most of the cast additionally making dash dancing even smoother (Credit to JOB)
    - Time to accelerate to max initial dash speed: 6F 🠚 1F
    - Dash 🠚 Roll window: 5F 🠚 1F

    - All dash and pivot grab ranges have been increased moderately
  - Dash grab friction has been decreased (1.6 🠚 1)
  - Characters can no longer pass through opponents during standing grabs and dash grabs to facilitate more consistent grabbing; pivot grabs still have standard jostle and can pass through opponents

- ### ![](images/Aspose.Words.f93ce4e3-25f6-48dc-9813-fc237aafe008.002.png) Footstools:
  - Footstools are now performed by pressing taunt instead of jump
  - Footstool Velocity (Fullhop/Shorthop): 1.3/0.7 🠚 0.8/0.5
  - Footstool Invincibility Removed 
    - Invincibility frames 4 🠚 0
  - ` `Footstool lockout window after hitstun increased ?? 🠚 8F
  - You can no longer airdodge out of a footstool until after F20

- ### ![](images/Aspose.Words.f93ce4e3-25f6-48dc-9813-fc237aafe008.002.png)Jabs:
  - All jab moves that are not the rapid jab finisher have had their knockback adjusted to be better suited for combos

- ### ![](images/Aspose.Words.f93ce4e3-25f6-48dc-9813-fc237aafe008.002.png) Ledges:
  - Characters can no longer grab the ledge while rising during an airborne state. You can now only grab ledge while either falling or with zero vertical velocity, rather than strictly falling (exceptions to these rules unchanged)
  - 2-Framing has been completely removed; ledgegrab animations are a consistent intangible 8 frames regardless of if grabbing from above or below
  - Ledge Hogging
    - Characters can no longer grab ledge while another character is occupying the ledge. Tethers are an exception, and will cause a ledge trump when the tethered character pulls themself toward the ledge
  - Ledge Intangibility
    - Ledge intangibility duration: 47F 🠚 37F
    - The remainder of iframes persist throughout any action after a ledgedrop
    - Landing on the ground will clear the iframes, meaning *intangible ledgedashes are not possible*
  - You cannot grab ledge during the first few frames after running off a ledge
  - Buffering is cleared when missing a tech and sliding off a ledge or platform to prevent accidental airdodges
  - Tether recoveries no longer occupy ledge until the characters rewinds to ledge
  - Tether recoveries are now forced into a ledge trump upon rewinding to an occupied ledge; after getting trumped, the character is allowed one action before going into special fall, and is forced into special fall landing upon hitting the ground
  - Max ledge tethers normalized with normal ledge grab limit 5 🠚 6
  - Tether rewind ledge wait FAF decreased 20F 🠚 7F
  - Ledge Grab FAF: 20 🠚 7

  - Regrab Timer
    - Drop/After Hit: 44F/30F 🠚 25F/25F
  - Ledge Trump FAF: 28 🠚 30
  - Ledge Trump Horizontal Speed: 0.9 🠚 -0.2
  - Ledge snap windows for all special moves pushed further toward end of move

- ### ![](images/Aspose.Words.f93ce4e3-25f6-48dc-9813-fc237aafe008.002.png) Inputs:
  - Tap Buffer: 9F 🠚 5F
    - Input Buffer Extension: 2F 🠚 0F
  - Mostly removed vanilla Ultimate’s hold buffer
    - Hold buffer is preserved during certain states such as jumpsquat or Nana’s spotdodge
    - During hitstun and shieldstun, there is a 5 frame tap extension buffer
  - Buffer is now active during new cancels (land cancel/hammers etc)
  - Removed the forced shorthop when buffering an aerial
    - This change retains the ability to attack cancel while allowing the ability to buffer full hop aerials, allowing you to buffer frame-perfect fullhop aerials as well as fullhop attack cancels
  - Stick sensitivity has been adjusted as follows:
    - Low: Smash attacks can occur until frame 2 of analog press
    - Normal: Smash attacks can occur until frame 4 of analog press
    - High: Smash attacks can occur until frame 6 of analog press
    - As a reference, vanilla Ultimate’s normal stick sensitivity is frame 6
  - C-Stick drift has been completely removed and the macro has been reprogrammed from scratch to mitigate inconsistencies and provide cleaner Bidou/Aidou implementation
  - Buffered airdodges out of hitstun have been disabled
  - Buffered spotdodges/rolls out of wavedash have been disabled, making consecutive wavedashes and buffering shield out of wavedash more consistent
  - Perfect/buffered wavedashes out of jumpsquat now transition you directly into landing, allowing for much smoother movement
  - Jump cancels now work properly with tap jump
  - Pivot horizontal stick detection window increased 0.0 🠚 0.075
- Command inputs		
  - Special command life increased 10F 🠚 12F
  - Super Special (Final Smash) command life increased: 22F

- ### ![](images/Aspose.Words.f93ce4e3-25f6-48dc-9813-fc237aafe008.002.png)Camera: 
  - Stage cameras have been reworked across the board to have faster player tracking and zoom to compensate for lack of balloon knockback and faster overall movement
  - Frames to trigger weak camera shake
    - 50 🠚 125
  - Frames to trigger strong camera shake
    - 70 🠚 155
  - Camera shake on medium/strong hits removed
  - Medium screen shake KB threshold: ?? 🠚 50
  - Strong screen shake KB threshold ?? 🠚90
  - Screen shake hitstun threshold for weak and strong screen shake increased (85/95 🠚 125/155) 
  - Fixed visual rotation angles on certain direction-reversion actions
  - Added unrestricted camera to all stages

- ### ![](images/Aspose.Words.f93ce4e3-25f6-48dc-9813-fc237aafe008.002.png) Other:
  - Characters’ double jumps are now returned upon being grabbed
  - Characters’ voice clips for sustaining heavy knockback now play on frame 1 of hitstun instead of frame 6
